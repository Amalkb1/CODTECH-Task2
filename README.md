# Linear Regression Project in Python - E-commerce Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** in analyzing and predicting key metrics in an **e-commerce** context. Linear Regression is used to uncover relationships between variables, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer behavior and trends based on historical e-commerce data. The key steps include:  
1. **Data Collection**: Loading and exploring e-commerce datasets.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and selecting relevant features for the model.  
3. **Model Implementation**:  
   - Implementing Linear Regression to predict metrics like sales, customer spending, or website traffic.  
   - Using Python libraries such as `scikit-learn` for efficient model building.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.  
5. **Visualization**: Plotting regression results to highlight insights such as sales trends or customer behavior patterns.  

## Use Case
The project showcases how e-commerce businesses can leverage Linear Regression for:  
- Predicting sales based on marketing spend.  
- Analyzing the impact of website visits on revenue.  
- Identifying factors influencing customer purchase decisions.  

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
